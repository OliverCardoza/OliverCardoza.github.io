tl;dr - I write about my personal workflow, principles, and tools for getting things done.

Last month I decided to leave my job and start something new. Apparently, I’m not alone as [The Great Resignation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Resignation) appears to be an ongoing trend in 2021. I took this opportunity to finally read David Allen’s book [Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) (GTD). I find that the best time to pick up new habits is often alongside a big life change. You get a bit of a fresh start which makes it easier to integrate new ideas.

In this post I want to talk a little bit about the main ideas from the book and how I’m starting to integrate them in my life. For context, this is not my first foray into the productivity space. I’ve lived through the 4 Hour Work Week, Lifehacker, and productivity pr0n fads. I implemented a sophisticated workflow system using Evernote and Todoist to get through my engineering undergrad degree. I even had the privilege of working for several years on the Gmail team at Google. Throughout that time GTD had always been in my periphery but never rose to the top until now.

So what is Getting Things Done? Well it’s a book, originally published in 2001 by David Allen with a revised 2015 edition. It then spawned its own productivity movement with an annual conference and certified coaches. Now I’m not really interested in finding a new religion or joining a congregation of list-making [cargo cultists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming). So off the bat I was a little skeptical. I tried to inoculate myself against todo list bullshit by reading [The Rise and Fall of Getting Things Done](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-rise-and-fall-of-getting-things-done) and rereading [Todon’t](https://blog.codinghorror.com/todont/) by Jeff Atwood. A good summation of my skepticism is this quote of a quote with original attribution to Adam Wozniak:

> 1. Lists give the illusion of progress.
> 2. Lists give the illusion of accomplishment.
> 3. Lists make you feel guilty for not achieving these things.
> 4. Lists make you feel guilty for continually delaying certain items.
> 5. Lists make you feel guilty for not doing things you don't want to be doing anyway.
> 6. Lists make you prioritize the wrong things.
> 7. Lists are inefficient. (Think of what you could be doing with all the time you spend maintaining your lists!)
> 8. Lists suck the enjoyment out of activities, making most things feel like an obligation.
> 9. Lists don't actually make you more organized long term.
> 10. Lists can close you off to spontaneity and exploration of things you didn't plan for. (Let's face it, it's impossible to really plan some things in life.)

And like that I cracked open the book wearing [jade-colored glasses](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadeColoredGlasses). I was pleasantly surprised to find the content less dogmatic and opinionated than I feared. From the introduction:

> In truth, this book is not so much concerned with getting things done as it is championing appropriate engagement with your world–guiding you to make the best choice of what to do in each moment, and **eliminating distraction and stress about what you’re not doing.**

I think the last statement is especially important. I find many self-help and productivity practices to be overly prescriptive on The Right Way™ to do things. However, a tip from Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s [Antifragile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile_(book)) is that negative information (aka. The Wrong Way™ or "what not to do") is often more robust and stands the test of time.

So what are the via negativa principles presented in GTD? Here’s my list:

* Don’t use your brain as the primary home for your life’s 100+ tasks, projects, reminders, and appointments.
* Don’t unload your mental baggage into a list or note without periodic review
* Don’t write out, defer, or plan any task which would take < 2 mins to complete (just do it!)
* Don’t make yourself promises you can’t keep (commit to less, or renegotiate deals)
* Don’t desecrate your calendar with optional tasks or aspirational habits you won’t keep (e.g. “Go to Gym?”)
* Don’t implement an organization process that costs more time to maintain than it saves
* Don’t keep “maybe” / “someday” tasks in the same space as your mandatory tasks

I find there's a lot there I can truly get behind. The above list is not actually written in this fashion in the text as I think most people find negative phrases harder to understand. Instead the book had a prescriptive approach with a workflow.

The starting point is to wrangle all of the bits of info that tug on your mind into inboxes. This helps create some mental space to collect and organize them instead of letting them bounce around your head creating stress.

From there the items get triaged which is mostly a classification and organization exercise. A key component is making sure if the item is actionable to identify a 1 sentence outcome, and 1 sentence next action to make progress. This takes an item like `Winter car tires` and turns it into:

* Outcome: Change car tires to winter set
* Next Action: Call favorite mechanic (###-###-####) to make an appointment

The act of identifying the next action while not necessarily committing to doing it right now is simple and effective. For bigger projects this is especially important so you can start work on a smaller chunk. This also makes triage fast and enjoyable because you can crank through the inbox faster if you aren't completing each task as you go (unless it is small!). I've skipped over a lot of the details for specific organization categories. I think this is one area of the book which should really be personalized to each reader. The base template is really good but I think modern tools which offer periodic reminders, scheduled email send, and snoozing emails reduce the need for some of the proposed categories. How detailed should you be in your categorization structure? Well the book has a choice quote for that:

> The right amount of complexity is whatever creates optimal simplicity.

At the end of the triage process you should now have a list of concrete next actions which you can prioritize and get started on. Again, mental space is created by this method by filtering and cutting through all of the stuff which is not actionable now.

To keep all of this fresh, GTD recommends a weekly review of all your lists. This also has the benefit of avoiding the creation of a large backlog in your inbox.

TODO:
- respond to Todon't negatives
- update tl;dr and intro paragraphs to focus this as a review/reflection with subsequent practical advice to implement
