I'm bad at maintaining a personal website. I get really exciting about a blogging platform, spend the time setting it up, and then never use it. I think this time it'll be different but that's probably naive.

My original drive to create a personal website grew out of wanting complete ownership over a piece of the internet. It's not exactly hard to publish a site but I think it is hard to get all of the variables right. There's a tradeoff between ownership/control and ease of use. Another motivator to create a website is to get back to producing content. Over the years I've become more and more bothered by my consumer habits taking over any drive to produce things.

I'm also ridiculously afraid of sharing content publicly. It probably comes from the natural fear of not being accepted (and a lot of internet horror stories). Hopefully this website brings me some amount of catharsis. Hopefully nobody reads this.
