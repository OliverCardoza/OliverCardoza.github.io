tl;dr - I created a spreadsheet to figure out what Sandman comic issues are contained in which collections: [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jQsMPcsaZpUMGlgUNVmkdZO-Bvc5IY9csFjmuX0-Ogc/view#gid=0).

Those that know me know that I will consume anything created by Neil Gaiman. Books, comics, movies, tv shows, podcasts, [BBC Symphony Orchestra performances](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000ck1c)... anything. Look at this guy's bibliography on Wikipedia: [Neil Gaiman bibliography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gaiman_bibliography).

My latest consumption is his comic book series: [The Sandman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_\(Vertigo\)). It vaguely circles around Morpheus, the Lord of Dreams. I started off reading the paperback editions from my local library and was later gifted some of the [DC Absolute Editions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics_Absolute_Edition) for Christmas. While I'm not big into collecting, I decided I'd look into purchasing the rest of the series. It turns out that purchasing *all* of a comic series is no easy feat. Putting price and spinoffs aside, there is still the daunting task of navigating the multiple overlapping collections that have been published through the years. I really just wanted to understand what's included in each collection. The Sandman seems to have the basic paperback series, the Absolute Editions, and the Omnibus collection. I figured that someone else on the internet would have posted an explanation or graphic to sort this out but I couldn't find anything. Exhausting my options I decided to make a spreadsheet (natural instinct) to try and wrap my head around it all. Sharing it below in case others are interested in this series and would find it useful.
