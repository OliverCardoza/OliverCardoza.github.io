# recruiters.txt - A simple text file to improve recruitment conversations.
#
# This file is a bit of a response to an increased volume of cold recruitement
# emails. It's laughable to call this a problem but people have built solutions
# for much sillier things. The format is based on robots.txt which is used to
# request how automated programs should interact with a website. While
# recruiters are not robots they sure seem to send a lot of email ;)
#
# Below I'll share my preferences when working with recruiters. You don't have
# to follow it. It's a text file not a cop. But it may save you and me some
# time :)
#
# NOTE: Lines beginning with a '#' are comments and are included with the
# misguided belief that someone wants to write a script to parse this
# bologna (Salesforce Apex connector anyone?).
